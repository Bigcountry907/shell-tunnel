1. Overview

Tunnel shell through UNIX socket.
For example, server run as root will export root shell to any client.
As of Android versions 4.3, 4.4, this technique is able to serve as basis for
root kit.

2. Running

2.a. Server side
Run as root (on Android it can be run from /system/etc/install-recovery.sh):

 # shell-tunnel --daemon

(*) No need in ampersand, the shell daemon will run in background.

2.b. Client side

 $ shell-tunnel --client

(*) Add --echo argument to generate local echo - usually not required.

3. Building

 $ gcc shell-tunnel.c -Wall -O2 -lutil -static -DANDROID -o shell-tunnel

(*) -static flag is not required per se, but is appropriate when
    cross-compiling for ARM.
(*) When building for Android, add -DANDROID to compilation flags.
(*) Beyond being executable, no special flags are required.

4. Theory of operation

|-------|                      |--------|
| root  |<--stdin--<--socket<--| user   |
| shell |-->stdout->--socket-->| client |
|-------|                      |--------|
    ^                              /
    |                         ---/
   fork                   ---/
    |                 ---/
|--------|        ---/
| root   |    ---/
| shell  |<--/
| daemon |
|--------|

(*) Normally, the root shell process is the child of calling process. However,
    in shell-tunnel, the root shell process is the child of shell daemon
    process.
